        <p class="intro">Have you ever tried to plan a trip with your friends but could never seem to figure our each others schedules? One of the most frustrating things when trying to set up a trip or activity is texting all of your friends and trying to figure out when they will have time off work or be available to go do something. With Synced Schedule you can easily see when your friends are available and plan activities with them. This will reduce or eliminate the need to text all of your friends and figure out when they are available.</p>
