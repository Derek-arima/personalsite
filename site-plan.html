        Have you ever tried to plan a trip with your friends but could never seem to figure our each others schedules? One of the most frustrating things when trying to set up a trip or activity is texting all of your friends and trying to figure out when they will have time off work or be available to go do something. With Synced Schedule you can easily see when your friends are available and plan activities with them. This will reduce or eliminate the need to text all of your friends and figure out when they are available.

      </ul>
      <h3>Get Started</h3>
      <p>
        Get started by creating an account and adding your account detail. You can then add your friends and create a calender for your group. The calender will show when your friends are available and when they are not. You can then create events and invite your friends to them. The events will show up on your friends calender and they can accept or decline the event. If they accept the event will show up on their calender and they will be able to see the event details. If they decline the event will not show up on their calender and they will not be able to see the event details.

      <h3>Why us?</h3>
      <p>
        Why would you want to use this? Synced Schedule makes planning activities and trips a lot easier and less time consuming. Take the endless texting trying to figure out when all of your friends might have some time to get together. The website will block out the times that your friends are not available and color code each person so you can clearly and easily see who wouldn't be available at that time.
